# Optimizing-University-Research-Computing-Operations

## Overview:

In the bustling ecosystem of University research computing, efficiency is paramount. At the University of Rochester's Center for Integrated Research Computing (CIRC), the mission is to support the diverse computational needs of researchers across various disciplines. To streamline operations and enhance user experience, a project was initiated to leverage the prowess of data science.

## The Challenge:

With multiple high-performance computing clusters churning out vast volumes of log files, the small team at CIRC faced a Herculean task. Insights were needed to tackle high volume contention issues, minimize extensive wait times, mitigate failed jobs, and optimize downtime maintenance windows.

## Approach:
I spearheaded the efforts. My expertise in data science, along with programming skills, facilitated the analysis of log files and cluster scheduling data. By extracting patterns associated with contention issues, wait times, and failed jobs, the aim was to optimize operational processes.

## Key Achievements:
Through data analysis, I identified optimal maintenance windows and improved resource allocation strategies. By quantifying patterns in the log files, I gained insights into system usage trends, facilitating informed decision-making for resource management. The project's success underscores the value of data-driven approaches in enhancing research computing operations.

## Next Steps:
Building on the insights gained from this project, further optimizations can be pursued.

**Real-time Monitoring:** Implement a system for real-time monitoring of cluster activity to enable proactive identification of issues and dynamic resource allocation.

**Predictive Analytics:** Develop predictive models to forecast resource demand based on historical usage patterns, enabling better capacity planning and allocation.

**Automation:** Explore opportunities to automate maintenance scheduling and job prioritization based on predicted usage patterns, thereby reducing manual intervention and optimizing system efficiency.

**User Feedback Integration:** Incorporate feedback from researchers regarding their computing needs to continuously refine and tailor resource allocation strategies.

By continuously iterating and refining our approach, we can ensure that the University's research computing infrastructure remains at the forefront of efficiency and effectiveness, empowering researchers to push the boundaries of knowledge and innovation.
